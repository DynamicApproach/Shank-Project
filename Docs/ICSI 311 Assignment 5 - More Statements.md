# ICSI 311 Assignment 5 – More statements

In this assignment, we will fill in the rest of the core functionality in the lexer and parser to
give our language a “real” language feeling – calling functions, loops, and conditionals. We will
also tweak our expression handling to allow us to **use** variables and we will also add modulo.

## Lexer changes

We need to add several new keywords to our lexer. This is, remember, as easy as making new tokens
and adding them to our hash map. You will need:

* `if, then, else, elsif, for, from, to, while, repeat, until, mod`

We also need the boolean comparators (tokens and lexer changes):

* `> , <, >=, <=, =, <> (not equal)`

## AST Nodes

We need to make `ASTNodes` for:

* `BooleanExpression` (has a left expression and a right expression and a condition)
* `While` (booleanExpression and collection of statementNodes)
* `Repeat` (booleanExpression and collection of statementNodes)
* `For` (variableReference, start ASTNode, end astNode, collection of statementNodes)
* `If` is a little bit interesting. How do we model that unlimited length chain of “elsif”?
* A linked list: `If` (booleanExpression, collection of statementNodes, ifNode)
* For else, you can either use a null boolean expression or make an ElseNode that derives from
  IfNode. One is more work now, one is more work later.
* Add modulo to MathOpNode.

*Parser Changes*

*Our simple boolean expressions are left-to-right, no precedence, so we can implement them without
the expression-term-factor pattern.*

*They also don’t chain (1<b<2 style) so we don’t need any recursion.*

* *Implement a **booleanExpression** method in the parser that generates a `booleanExpressionNode`.*

*Previously, the only statement type we had was assignments.

Now, we will add the loops and conditionals (if). The key thing to notice is that every statement is
one of these. Make new functions for while, for and if, following the pattern that we have seen:*

```
1)      Look for keywords to discern if this function is applicable***
2)      If not, make sure that we haven’t taken any tokens and return null.***
    
    Add modulo to term, much the same as multiplication or division.
    
  *Right now, we can’t make an expression that references a variable.*

  For example: c:=b+1
```

*We can add this by making factor accept an identifier (and creating a `variableReferenceNode`).*

Testing

We can now test with real programs, so long as they don’t call functions (hint – that’s next). Use
some of the test programs we wrote in our first assignment but remove the function calls. Make sure
that they parse correctly.
