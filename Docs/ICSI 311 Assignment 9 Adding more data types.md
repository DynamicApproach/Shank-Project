# ICSI 311 Assignment 9 – Adding More Data Types

[Previous Assignment](./ICSI%20311%20Assignment%208%20%20Adding%20other%20statements.md)

**This is the end! How you do on this assignment doesn’t impact any others!**

**You must submit .java files. Any other file type will be ignored. Especially “.class” files.**

**You must not zip or otherwise compress your assignment. Blackboard will allow you to submit
multiple files.**

***You must submit buildable .java files for credit.***

## Background

Now that we have completed the work for int and float, we are going to go back and add other data
types. This is a very common pattern – adding a new feature once you have something working. Instead
of “just” working in the interpreter, we will touch every piece, but just a little.

There are several data types remaining. We will leave arrays and variable ranges for next
assignment.

**Boolean** – we need to add keywords “true” and “false”, allow variables of the type boolean, allow
assignment and allow them to be used in places where we expect boolean expressions (like in “if” and
“while”).

**Character and string** – like boolean, we need to allow them to be declared and assigned to. This
requires us to add single and double quotes to the lexer. We also need to add them to the boolean
expressions so that we can say something like:

    if myString =”hello” then

Finally, we have some new built-in functions to implement.

My approach is to work module by module – lexer, then parser and AST, then interpreter.

It would be
perfectly reasonable to split these the other way and add a whole data type, then the next, etc.

## The Lexer

We need to add keywords for the new types, true, false. Then we need to add single quote and double
quote modes (like we did for comments). I started by making the tokens. Note that for both single
and double quotes, I don’t make individual tokens for start quote and end quote. Instead, I created
a “CharContents” and “StringContents”. Note that one thing that we need to do is enforce the length
limit of 1 character on CharContents.

##                

## The Parser

Let’s start with adding the new variable types.

We implemented **BooleanExpression**() specifically for loops and conditions. That made sense
because we
knew from context that the type of expression had to be boolean (because it followed a key word like
“if”). We also didn’t have a type for boolean.

We are going to merge our boolean expression into our **expression**() function. This might seem a
little weird – 2+2 seems different from x>2. But, are they? They are both mathematical expressions
that return a value.

Create a BoolNode like we created `IntNode` and `FloatNode`. Change **Factor**() to return a
`BoolNode` when it finds the true and false tokens.

Then merge in from your existing code the boolean operators (
less than, less than or equal, etc.) to ExpressionRightHandSide.
Remember that we can’t chain booleans like we do addition and subtraction; that is to say 2+3+4 is
allowed, but 4>x>9 is not
allowed.


------------------------------------


Likewise, create a `CharNode` and a `StringNode` for those data types. Add those to **Factor**() as
well.
This will allow expressions to serve for all of our assignment statements. One might protest that
this allows all sorts of invalid things like:

2+”this is a test”\*’c’

That is true. But remember that the parser’s job is to build the AST that the user specified. We
will walk through it to make sure that the types all make sense.


--------------------------

## Semantic Analysis

This is an additional step that is performed once parsing is complete.
In this step, we analyze the AST. In this step, we have all the data of the complete AST, so we can
do things like ensure (for example) that all variables are declared. In `Shank`, this is not an
issue,
since all variables are at the function scope (and declared at the top), but think about Java where
a member variable could be declared after it is used in a method.

Create a new class called `SemanticAnalysis`. Add a method called “**CheckAssignments**”. We will
pass our
collection of functions to this method. For each function, we need to look at every assignment
statement (remember that they could be in sub-blocks like inside an “if” hint - recursion).

Consider
the variable on the left side of the assignment as the “correct” type. Make sure that everything on
the right side of the assignment is the same type. If it is not, throw an exception. Add as much
information as you can to help the user debug this.

- Remember that string + character and character +
  string are allowable (both create a string).
    - It’s OK to assume that char and string are
      interchangeable for this check. Also remember that operands can be variables or constants. You
      may
      need to make several functions to implement this – I did.

Call this method from “main” before you call the interpreter.

## The interpreter

Add new `InterpreterDataTypes` for character, string and boolean.

Implement the built-in functions for strings (refer to the Language Definition document).

Create **ResolveBoolean**, **ResolveString** and **ResolveCharacter** similar to how we implemented
**ResolveInteger** and **ResolveFloat**. Implement the operator + for string/string,
character/string and
string/character. Use **ResolveBoolean** for if, while and repeat statements. This will allow us to
use
variables for conditions:

    if done then
    
           a:=a+1
    
    else
    
           a:=a-1

Add string, boolean and character types to function calls.

When this is complete, you should be able to use string, character and boolean anywhere in a Shank
program that makes sense. Since each of your programs will vary, you will need to find any places
that need additional changes.
