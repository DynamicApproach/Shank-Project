**This assignment is extremely important – (nearly) every assignment after this one uses this one!**

**If you have bugs or missing features in this, you will need to fix them before you can continue on
to new assignments. This is very typical in software development outside of school.**

**You must submit .java files. Any other file type will be ignored. Especially “.class” files.**

**You must not zip or otherwise compress your assignment. Blackboard will allow you to submit
multiple files.**

***You must submit buildable .java files for credit.***

In this assignment, we will finish up the lexer and parser (for now) and start on the work to get
the interpreter completed. We will start by adding the code to lex/parse function calls. Then we
will implement the built-in functions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adding Function Calls

We start by adding “var” to the lexer tokens and the hash map of known keywords.
Remember that “var” is the key word that allows us to alter passed in variables
– passing by reference rather than by value.

We need to add an AST node for function calls. This is a new `StatementNode`. A function call has a
name (of the function) and a list of parameters.

A parameter needs to be its own ASTNode.
Remember that a parameter can be a variable (`VariableReferenceNode`) or a constant value (an
ASTNode)
It can have “var” or not have var. Remember to add a “ToString()” for these nodes for debugging.

Next we have to add function calls to the parser. A function call is a name followed by a comma
separated list of 0 or more cases of one of three cases:

```
var name

name

value (which could be int or float)
```

Finally, we need to add this to the Statement() function in the parser so that function calls become
a valid statement type.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Built-In: AST Nodes

Next, we will need an ASTNode for our built-in functions.

There is a significant difference between functions that are user-defined in `Shank` (which we have
done already) and functions that are pre-defined (like read and write).
The user-defined functions have statements, for example, while the pre-defined functions have Java
code to implement them.

So it makes sense to have two different classes with a common base type.

1. [ ] Make a common base type of “`CallableNode`”, which derives from ASTNode.
2. [ ] 
3. [ ] It will have a function name and a list of `VariableNodes` for the parameters – you can move
   this from the existing `functionNode`.
4. [ ]  This class should be abstract.
5. [ ] Then we need to build `BuiltInFunctionNode` and `FunctionNode`.
6. [ ] BuiltInFunctions can do something that user-defined functions cannot (so far) – accept any
   number of
7. [ ] parameters of any type (like read and write do).
8. [ ] This is called **variadic**. C and Java both do this.
9. [ ] Make a `boolean in BuiltInFunctions` to indicate if this built-in is variadic.
10. [ ] FunctionNode needs to now inherit from `CallableNode` and to use the inherited Parameter
    variables.

    Node -> CallableNode -> BuiltInFunctionNode

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Built-In – Parameters

There are two aspects to parameters, and this can get a little confusing. When we make a function,
we declare the parameters to the function:

    define someFunction ( a,b:integer)

When we call that function, the function call has parameters:

    someFunction 3,4

These are all stored in the AST tree. But there is a third aspect that we need to think about – the
data storage at interpreter time. The AST is different – we don’t want to change that while we are
running the code.

We need a data structure that the interpreter can use to hold data without changing the values in
the AST.

Create a new set of classes: `InterpreterDataType`, `IntDataType`, `FloatDataType`.

The first is an abstract base class. It is it's own parent. It declares a ToString and a FromString:

        public abstract String ToString();
        public abstract void FromString(String input); // sets the value of the data type by parsing the string

No constructor and no member.

The int and float versions should extend InterpreterDataType have a Value (of the appropriate type)
They should implement FromString() and ToString() – we will use these in our read and write
functions.

Finally, we are going to go make one quick addition to `BuiltInFunctionNode` – add an abstract
method (making the whole class abstract) called Execute.
Execute will take a collection of `InterpreterDataType` objects. Why? Well, when the interpreter
finds
a call to “`read`”, for example, it
has to be able to call your Java code.
eg. Read will take a collection of `InterpreterDataType` objects and set the values of those objects
from user input
(remember that read can take any number of parameters).
eg. Write will take a collection of `InterpreterDataType` objects and print them to the screen.

Now subclass BuiltInFunctionNode for each of the functions that we can implement so far:

    read

Read is going to read from the console. Remember that Shank doesn’t have return values. Read,
therefore, must mutate the incoming IDTs. All the executes take a collection of IDT and return
void.

    write
    squareRoot(float)
    getRandom(float)
    integerToReal(float)
    realToInteger(float)

Implement the Execute function for each of these.

Use the collection of `InterpreterDataType` to get parameters and to output to variable parameters.

Make sure that you check the data types of the `InterpreterDataTypes`.

Throw exceptions if the functions are called incorrectly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Testing

Create some function calls in your code. Ensure that the AST nodes print. We will test our built-in
code next assignment.
