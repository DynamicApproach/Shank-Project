### Adding words to the lexer!

We start in the lexer. We will need a new state for “words”.

Be careful about the transition from
“number” state to “word” state and vice versa; make sure that you deal with the character
accumulation correctly.

It might be tempting to use a single large group of “if-then” blocks for
this.

I have found that it is easier to reason about by separating my logic by state. So I have
something like this (pseudo-code):

    if (state is word) {
    
          switch (currentCharcter) {
    
          }
    
    } else if (state is number)  {
    
          switch (currentCharacter) {
    
          }
    
    Else if …

There are two types of words that we need to deal with.

One type is reserved words, which we know ahead of time (like “integer” and “float” and
“variable”).
1.
  * For reserved words, we will want to output specific tokens.
    The other type is words that we don’t know about in advance, like function names or variable
    names.

  * For other words, we will have a generic token (“identifier”).

    A super easy way to do this is to make a HashMap  (String, TokenType) of
    reserved words. When your lexer completes a word, look in the HashMap; if it is in there,
    create
    a Token using that TokenType.
  * Otherwise, use the “Identifier” token type.

2)

  * Create the token types that we need:
    Identifier, define, leftParen, rightParen, integer, float, begin, end, semicolon, colon, equal,
    comma, variables, constants
  * Add integer, real, begin, end, variables, constants to the HashMap with their matching token
    type.
  * Add the state(s) for “words”. When you find a word, look it up in the hashmap and make a token,
    as
    described above.
  * Add comma, colon, equal and semicolon to your lexer as well (these are just
    characters like plus and minus were).

# Parser Changes

With that complete, we can look at the parser. We want to start with a subset of our language.
Consider this piece of code:

    define start (t : integer; s : real)
    
    define identifier leftParen identifier colon integer semicolon identifier colon real rightParen
    endOfLine
    
    constants
    
    constants endOfLine
    
    pi=3.141
    
    identifier equal number endOfLine
    
    variables
    
    variables endOfLine
    
    a,b,c : integer
    
    identifier comma identifier comma identifier colon integer endOfLine
    
    begin
    
    begin endOfLine
    
    end
    
    end endOfLine

How could we describe this? There is a function declaration line, then a constants section, then a
variables section, then a body. The function declaration is required. The constants and variables
sections may not be in every function. A body is required.

The **function declaration** is the word “define”, then a name, left parenthesis, then a list of
variable declarations, separated by semicolons and finally a right parenthesis.
The constants section has one (or more) name/value pairs.

The variables have one (or more) lists of names followed by a colon followed by a data type.
One non-obvious element is that constants have a data type, too.
It is just inferred from the value.

- Given this, let’s add a new ASTElement that represents both – `VariableNode`. The `VariableNode`
  should
  have a name, an “is constant”, an enum for data type (integer and real, for now) and an ASTNode
  for
  the initial value (which will be a `FloatNode` or an `IntNode`, for now).

Make sure that you add a
**ToString**() method that prints all the fields in a readable way – this helps a lot for
debugging.

To build the parser, we follow the description above.

Make a “**FunctionDefinition**” function. It looks for “define”.
If it finds that token, it starts building a functionAST node .
It populates the name from the identifier, then looks for the left parenthesis. It then looks for
variable declarations (see below). We then call the Constants, then Variables, then Body function
from below.

The functionAST node should have 2 different collection classes of `VariableNode` – one for
parameters and one for local variables.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- It should include the “ToString()” method, which should output the
  local variables and the parameterVariables as well as the function name.
  We make a “**Constants**” function.
- It looks for the constants token. If it finds it, it calls a
  “**processConstants**” function that looks for tokens in the format:

            Identifier equals number endOfLine

It should make a `VariableNode` for each of these – this should be a loop until it doesn’t find an
identifier anymore.
We then make a Variables function that looks for the variables token. If it finds it, it then looks
for variable declarations and makes `VariableNodes` for each one.

A variable declaration is a list of identifiers (separated by commas) followed by a colon, then the
data type (integer or real, for now) followed by endOfLine (for variables section) or a semicolon (
for function definitions).

For each variable, we make a `VariableNode` like we did for constants.
We then make a **BodyFunction** that looks for begin, endOfLine, end, endOfLine.
Right now, we don’t
do anything with these. We should now be able to parse function declarations!

Testing
To test your code, remove the call to **Resolve**() in the **Interpreter** and to **Expression**()
in the Parser
from your main. Instead, call **FunctionDefinition**. We will use Resolve() and Expression() again
soon,
so don’t delete them. From your main, print out the **FunctionDefinitions** using the ToString() so
that
you can be sure that they parsed correctly.
